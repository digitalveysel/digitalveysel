Hi, I'm Veysel in digital world.

Since I know myself, I really like to research, ask questions about why and how. I live somewhere at the intersection of technology and design with the goal of developing and producing. I write down what I feel at this intersection at my (https://veysel.co/notlar) notes.

I am currently working in the fields of Front-End Development, User Experience and Search Engine Optimization in the web world.

If you want to know more about my work, you can visit my personal web (https://veysel.co) address.
