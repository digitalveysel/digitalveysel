Hi there! I'm Veysel Demirel.

I'm a passionate software developer and digital product designer living in **Eskişehir, Türkiye**. I’m absolutely loving my journey into the digital world! I’ve always had a passion for diving deep into research, asking those why and how questions. I thrive at the intersection of technology and design. My goal is to produce innovative and effective solutions in every project.
