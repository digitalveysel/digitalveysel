Hi, I'm Veysel in digital world. Since I know myself, I love to investigate, ask questions of why and how. I live somewhere at the intersection of technology and art with the purpose of developing and producing. I feel at this intersection in my notes (https://veysel.co/notlar/).

I am developing myself in the fields of ‚Äúmathematics‚Äù, which are essential all over life, ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù, which changes our world, and ‚Äúdesign‚Äù, which is the point where the two merge.

If you want to learn more about my work, you can visit my personal web (https://veysel.co) address.
